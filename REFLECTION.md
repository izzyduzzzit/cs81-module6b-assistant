# Izarra Villareal CS 81 JavaScript Module 6 Assignment 6B: Personal Assistant

# What made your assistant “personal” to you?
The tasks were things I do in my life currently or things I need to do. I also referenced calling my best friend by name.

# What challenges did you face using this?
The only real challenge I faced was cleaning up VS Code's autocomplete code. It is time saving, but you have to have a trained eye to make the comments and code accurate for your needs. It isn't always correct in predicting what youre trying to do. I had a little bit of a learning curve understanding the difference between a method that receives a parameter and a method that does not. I cleaned that up from the autocomplete code though as it was incorrect in predicting what I was trying to create. I need to better understand math and the random method within math. It was also kind of difficult for me to wrap my brain around how this would be used in the real world so I just envisioned adding tasks to Google Calendar which wouldn't exactly be a 1:1 analog.

# Which method would you improve or expand?
I would like to improve and expand upon the complete task function to allow for task edit and to allow for specific task selection using index tracking.
